Based on the step change between top solution times in previous years and 2024, it is clear that most people are using AI to speed up their time to submission. I was definitely not looking to grind to try for consistent leaderboards, so my goal was just to have fun. Thus, I wrote my solutions by hand, using mostly functional style code. The result is twofold:

1. I proved to myself that I can still solve hard problems
2. My solutions are borderline unreadable and very clearly written by a human

Feel free to use my helper functions if you'd like. They are not the fastest but I would argue they are fun and elegant.
